WatiN 0.8.0.4000 (31 August, 2006)

** Changes in general **

* WatiN is now available in a .Net 1.1 and .Net 2.0 distribution
* IE and HTMLDialog now support all functionality which in 0.7.0 was only 
  accessible by using IE.MainDocument.xxx. The MainDocument property has been 
  marked obsolete. You are encouraged to change your code because the MainDocument 
  property will be removed is the next release. To make this new syntax possible 
  some code breaking changes are introduced(see API Changes).
* Added support for finding elements with a regular expression.
* Added support for finding an Image by its Src (source) attribute and added 
  functionality to the Image class.
* Improved IE.HTMLDialog behaviour.
* Added support to get the active element (element with the focus) in a document.
* Added IE.PressTab which sends a Tab key to IE. This allows tabbing through the 
  elements (and address bar). Combined with Document.ActiveElement this makes it 
  possible to do some usability testing.
* IE constructors throw a InvalidThreadState exception if code is not executed on 
  a single threaded apartment. Read the 'WatiN and Thread.ApartmentState' article 
  on http://watin.sourceforge.net for more information.
* Added 2 new constructors to WatiN.Core.IE that accept an System.Uri instance.
* Added support for firing events on elements with no id (only for elements not 
  shown in an HtmlDialog).
* Added IE.GetWindowStyle to determine the window style (normal, minimized, maximized, etc).
* Updated documentation (all class have an explanation about their purpose)
* Updated build file to support building both a .Net 1.1 and .Net 2.0 version.
* Updated and added (many) unit tests.
* Added Microsoft.mshtml.dll to the distribution files.


** API Changes **

Attribute class (and subclasses)
* Renamed AttributeValue to Attribute. All subclasses are renamed accordingly (BREAKING CHANGE).
* Added Regex support for Attribute and it's subclasses.
* Attribute class now overrides ToString which returns the same as the Value property.
* Attribute constructor now allows for empty Value parameter.

Document class
* Added support to get the active element (element with the focus) of a document
* Added Document.Uri which returns a System.Uri instance of the Document.Url.
* throws an InvalidAttributException when searching for an element by an invalid attribute.

DomContainer class [inherits Document]
* Inherits Document class.
* Property HtmlDocument now returns IHTMLDocument2 instead of HtmlDocument(BREAKING CHANGE).
* Dispose method changed from public to internal (BREAKING CHANGE).

Find class
* Added Regex factory methods.
* Added support for finding an Image by its Src (source) attribute.

IE class [Inherits DomContainer]
* Url property is now inherited from Document instead of returning the url in the 
  navigation bar. Result should be the same although the encoding of the url might 
  be a bit different. (BREAKING CHANGE).
* Added 2 new constructors to WatiN.Core.IE that accept a System.Uri instance.
* Added IE.PressTab which sends a Tab key to IE. This allows tabbing through the 
  elements (and address bar). Combined with Document.ActiveElement this makes it 
  possible to do some usability testing.
* Added IE.GetWindowStyle to determine the window style (normal, minimized, maximized, etc).

Image class [Inherits Element]
* Added Src, Alt and Href properties.

Src class [Inherits Attribute]
* New class to support finding an Image by its Src (source) attribute.

-------------------------------
WatiN 0.7.0.4000 (8 July, 2006)

* In the previous release running the unittests from the binary watin.unittest.dll resulted in 
  a lot of open IE windows because the HTML files were not distributed in the right place.
  This problem is solved in this distribution. The logic to find the location of the HTML files
  is also changed so the test can be both run by the binary and in de VS2003 IDE 
  using "Test Driven.net"
* Added documentation and examples to the source code resulting in beter support by intellisense when
  using WatiN during your development. There's also a helpfile available (WatiN.chm). 
  Although the most important parts are documented to get you started with WatiN, there is still 
  a lot to be documented.
* Removed microsoft.mshtml.dll from the distribution because it's unclear if it's legal to 
  distribute it this way. WatiN now references the version registered in the GAC.
* Improved the build file.
