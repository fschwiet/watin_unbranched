WatiN 0.7.0.4000 (July 8, 2006)

* In the previous release running the unittests from the binary watin.unittest.dll resulted in 
  a lot of open IE windows because the HTML files were not distributed in the right place.
  This problem is solved in this distribution. The logic to find the location of the HTML files
  is also changed so the test can be both run by the binary and in de VS2003 IDE 
  using "Test Driven.net"
* Added documentation and examples to the source code resulting in beter support by intellisense when
  using WatiN during your development. There's also a helpfile available (WatiN.chm). 
  Although the most important parts are documented to get you started with WatiN, there is still 
  a lot to be documented.
* Removed microsoft.mshtml.dll from the distribution because it's unclear if it's legal to 
  distribute it this way. WatiN now references the version registered in the GAC.
* Improved the build file.


WatiN 0.6.3.3007 (May 32, 2006)
