This file lists things that still need to be done. 

Maybe a roadmap for the upcoming WatiN releases should be made. Then these TODO's 
can be assigned to a release. So first ting to do

- create roadmap for WatiN releases

- support for PRE element/tag
- support for messageboxes (dialogs with Yes, No, Cancel etc.. buttons)
- support for filedownload
- support for login window
- possibility to inherit from a particular WatiN element (like TextField) and
  making this usefull. Work needs to be done on how WatiN finds an element
  and the way it returns the WatiN.Element instance.
- support for finding an element with xpath needed?
- support for finding an element by multiple attributes needed?
- creating an installer for WatiN (MSI or NullSoft?)
- creating NAnt build script
- Adding documentation to the code
- creating documentation with NDoc
- test WatiN with Internet Explorer 7 (beta 2)
- more unittests (and more code coverage)
